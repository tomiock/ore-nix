# ORE-CLI Nix dev environment

Here I have a Nix shell (at the moment) and a bash scripts that allow you to mine ORE at your own pace. I aim to have a containerized environment that can be easily deployable. 

> Ore is a solana crypto that aims for dynamic rewards depending on your HASH/s of your CPU. No matter if you have a Nokia phone or a Threadripper, you will be able to mine. See the [ORE github repo](https://github.com/regolith-labs/ore-cli) for more info

Future features
